### 🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practicum – 3rd Semester

This repository contains a collection of introductory materials, exercises, experiments, assignments, and missions for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practicum** course in the **3rd semester**.
All works are written in **Java**, implementing core OOP principles such as **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**, along with advanced topics including **Interfaces, Exception Handling, Collections**, and simple **Design Patterns**.

* **Pendahuluan (Introduction):** Contains theoretical materials and fundamental concepts for each topic.
* **Latihan (Exercise):** Short coding practices to strengthen understanding before experiments.
* **Percobaan (Experiment):** Guided coding experiments applying discussed concepts.
* **Tugas (Assignment):** Individual or group tasks as practical implementations.
* **UTS (Midterm):** Contains the midterm project or assessment.
* **UAS (Final):** Contains the final project or comprehensive assessment.
* **Misi (Missions):** Challenge-based tasks designed to enhance OOP mastery.

#### ▶️ How to Run the Code

**1. If there is *no package* in the code:**

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

**2. If the file includes a *package declaration*, for example:**

```java
package praktikum1.latihan;
```

Then navigate to the **source root directory** (the folder that contains `praktikum1`) and run:

```bash
javac praktikum1/latihan/Main.java
java praktikum1.latihan.Main
```

> 💡 Note: The `package` name should match the folder structure exactly, and class names are case-sensitive.
